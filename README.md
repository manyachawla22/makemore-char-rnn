# Makemore — Character-Level Language Model

This project is my personal reimplementation of the *Makemore* character-level language model from Andrej Karpathy’s **"Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"** series.  
I followed the concepts step-by-step, rewrote the code in my own way, and added extra comments and explanations to strengthen my understanding of backpropagation, embeddings, and gradient flow.

## 📘 Notebooks
- **makemore_part1.ipynb** — Bigram model basics  
- **makemore_part2.ipynb** — Adding hidden layers (MLP)  
- **makemore_part3.ipynb** — Improving training and analysis  
- **makemore_part4_backprop.ipynb** — Full manual backpropagation  

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Character-level tokenization and generation  
- Implementing neural networks from scratch (NumPy + PyTorch)  
- Backpropagation and gradient updates  
- Fundamentals behind GPT-like architectures  

## 🧩 Tools Used
Python, NumPy, PyTorch, Matplotlib
